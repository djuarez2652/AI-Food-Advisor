Name, age, weight, weight goal, What is your goal and why? (stored in database)

3. What are the outputs?
Chatgpt advice(saved in database)


4. List 5 steps to go from input -> output
1. prompt user for input data
2. User inputs data/saves in database
3. call on api for response
4. Chatgpt api generates a response/ saves in database
5. prints output


5. What’s the biggest risk?
User can easily get leaked from the database if no protected correctly. Chatgpt api
could also give out misinformation on the healthy advice for the user as chatgpt is not always accurate.
